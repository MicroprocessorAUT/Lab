# Arduino Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Basically, the Arduino language is a subset of C/C++. You can create classes, use inheritance, composition, and many other nice OOP functionalities but how ?

in this introduction we want to learn how to use oop in arduino for more reusability, modularity, readability, etc.
lets start with a simple example
consider the below circuit:

We want to turn on LED 1 , 3 and turn off LED 2 , 4 when the button is pressed and opposite will happen after releasing the button.
Now let's see how to program this arduino in the clearest way using classes
